ICP_3 Explanation:

THe first code defines classes 'Employee' and 'FulltimeEmployee' creates instances of these classes and displays the average salary and total number of employees. The 'Employee' class has a class variable for counting employees and calculating total salary, a constructor to initialize instance variables and a class method to calculate the average salary. The 'FulltimeEmployee' class inherits from 'Employee'.

The second code generates a random vector reshapes it into a 4*5 array and replaces the maximum value in each row with 0. This is done efficiently without using a for loop.
